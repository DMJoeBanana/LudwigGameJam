# LudwigGameJam
Using the extra two hours granted I was able to at least add context to the story I had planned! (
This was my first ever game and game jam so I'm pretty happy with how it turned out :D)

Thank you for checking out my game!

I worked on this project completely solo, but a huge shoutout to Shaun Spalding as his guides helped me overcome many hurdles! Check him out at https://www.youtube.com/@ShaunJS
